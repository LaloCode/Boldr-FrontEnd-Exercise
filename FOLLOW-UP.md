### Follow Up Questions:

1. What libraries did you use? Why did you use them? <br><br>
I used the Angular MAterials library in order to get good looking UI quicker.

2. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add? <br><br>
First I would add a search option which should be quick since swagger provides an open query parameter, I would also improve pagination since Angular Material is pretty limited.

3. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?<br><br>
Getting pagination working even if it was limited was a challenge and pretty fun.

4. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?<br><br>
Setting up the interface for the API response, I found pagination to be the most challenging since there are a lot of ways to go about implementing it.
